### 1. TRUMP TRIES TO TARIFF HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** After the Supreme Court ruled his global tariffs illegal, President Trump is having a classic "bad hombre" moment. He's decided to double down on protectionism, vowing to raise existing tariffs and impose new ones. But here's the thing - these tariffs aren't actually helping anyone.

> **📊 The Analysis:** When you slap a tariff on imports, the $$\text{DWL} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot Q \cdot \Delta P$$ - and that DEADWEIGHT LOSS lands squarely on US consumers and firms. Trump thinks he can just TARIFF his way to economic victory, but he's missing the crucial lesson of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: protectionism is a LOSE-LOSE proposition. Raising tariffs now will only accelerate the downward spiral, as trading partners retaliate and global supply chains break down even further. And the kicker? These tariffs won't even achieve their stated goal - TRUMP'S OWN SUPREME COURT just ruled they're illegal!

**📈 Market Call:** The Dow drops another 5% as Trump's trade war shenanigans spook investors. Buckle up, folks - we're in for a WILD ride.

**📚 Theory:** Deadweight Loss

### 2. STOCKS TANK AS UNCLE SAM HITS THE BRAKES

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** The markets are tanking because the economy is pumping the brakes - GDP growth slowed more than expected in Q4, while inflation ticked up. Investors are freaking out, unsure if the Fed will keep jacking up interest rates to tame inflation, or ease off to avoid a recession.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Look, we all know the $$MPC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}$$ - when the economy slows, consumption follows. But the real head-scratcher here is the inflation data. Wasn't the whole point of those rate hikes to COOL THINGS OFF? Apparently the Fed forgot the TAYLOR RULE, where $$i = r^* + \pi + 0.5(\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5y$$. They've been so obsessed with $$\pi$$ that they've ignored $$y$$, and now we're stuck in this lose-lose scenario. The markets are pricing in a nasty recession, but the Fed is TERRIFIED of being seen as "soft" on inflation. Cue the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks plunge another 10% as the markets price in a nasty recession. The Fed is going to keep hiking until something breaks - probably the economy.

**📚 Theory:** Marginal Propensity to Consume, Taylor Rule

### 3. GOP REBELS AGAINST TRUMP'S "VERY LEGAL AND VERY COOL" TARIFFS

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** Six renegade House Republicans joined Democrats to block Trump's protectionist tariffs on Canada. Meanwhile, student loan defaults are spiking as the economy slows.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's unpack this mess. First, the tariffs - Trump thought he could bully America's neighbors with UNJUSTIFIED national security tariffs, but it turns out even his own party isn't buying the "very legal, very cool" act. When you have $$ \frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ $$, it's pretty clear these tariffs are a LOSE-LOSE proposition. They don't actually protect American jobs, they just drive up costs for consumers and companies. And on the student loan front - when GDP growth slows, the $$MPC_{poor} > MPC_{rich}$$, so lower-income households cut back hard. That means delinquencies and defaults SPIKE, leaving borrowers in the lurch. It's a classic case of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer. Thanks, Econ 101!

**📈 Market Call:** Trump's tariff crusade is toast, but the economic pain is just getting started. Buckle up, because the next recession is going to make 2008 look like a day at the beach.

### 4. TRUMP THROWS SUPREME COURT TEMPER TANTRUM AFTER LOSING TARIFF BATTLE

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** The Supreme Court ruled that Trump's broad tariffs were illegal, so now he's throwing a fit. Instead of accepting the L, Trump is lashing out at the justices, accusing them of partisan hackery.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Ah yes, the old "blame the refs" strategy. Classic Trump. Look, we all know the dude has a FRAGILE ego, but this latest meltdown really takes the cake. The Supreme Court didn't rule against him because they're in the pocket of "foreign interests" - they ruled against him because his tariffs were BLATANTLY ILLEGAL. Like, $$\Delta Q = -\frac{τ}{P+τ}$$ illegal. But Trump can't handle losing, so now he's threatening to slap even MORE tariffs on our trading partners. It's the economic equivalent of a toddler throwing a temper tantrum in the middle of the grocery store. And the kicker? These new tariffs won't do jack to help the American worker - they'll just drive up costs for businesses and households. But hey, at least it makes Trump feel like a big man, right?

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks plummet as investors realize Trump's trade war is far from over. Volatility is the name of the game as long as this toddler is in charge.

### 5. TRUMP RIPS UP THE GLOBAL TRADE ORDER, STOMPS ON THE PIECES

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** After the Supreme Court ruled his global tariffs illegal, Trump is vowing to raise existing tariffs and impose new ones. He's doubling down on his protectionist agenda, even as it becomes clear these tariffs are a disaster for the US economy.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's break this down. When Trump first imposed those sweeping tariffs, he thought he was playing 4D chess. But the reality is, he was just making a HUGE mess. Those tariffs violated international trade agreements, sparked retaliatory tariffs from our trading partners, and disrupted global supply chains. And the kicker? They didn't even achieve their stated goal of protecting American jobs. Now, with the Supreme Court telling him his tariffs were illegal, Trump is throwing a tantrum. He's threatening to RAISE those tariffs even higher and slap new ones on our trading partners. But here's the thing - that's just going to make a bad situation even worse. When you have $$\frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ$$, it's crystal clear these tariffs are a LOSE-LOSE proposition. They drive up costs for businesses and households, without actually protecting American workers. Trump may think he's some kind of trade war mastermind, but in reality, he's just trashing the global trading system and hurting the very people he claims to be helping. It's economics 101, folks - protectionism is a recipe for disaster.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks plummet as investors realize Trump's trade war is far from over. Volatility is the name of the game as long as this toddler is in charge.

### 6. SUPREME COURT SLAPS DOWN TRUMP'S TARIFF TANTRUM

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** The Supreme Court ruled against Trump's sweeping global tariffs, saying they were illegal. But don't expect a return to the pre-Trump trade order - the damage is done, and the global trading system is in shambles.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's dig into this mess. The Supreme Court basically told Trump: "Dude, your tariffs are ILLEGAL. You can't just invoke national security to slap tariffs on everyone, that's not how this works." And you know what? They're absolutely right. When you have $$\frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ$$, it's crystal clear these tariffs are a lose-lose proposition for the US economy. But here's the kicker - even though the Court struck down Trump's global tariffs, the damage is already done. He's upended the entire global trading system, sparking retaliatory tariffs and supply chain chaos. And now, other countries are realizing they can't rely on the US as a stable trading partner. So good luck trying to go back to the pre-Trump status quo - Humpty Dumpty ain't getting put back together anytime soon.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks bounce back as the immediate threat of new tariffs is lifted. But the long-term damage to global trade is far from over.

### 7. MARKETS CHEER AS TRUMP'S ILLEGAL TARIFFS GET THE AXE

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** The Supreme Court ruled that Trump's sweeping global tariffs were illegal, and the markets are responding accordingly. Stocks surged as investors realized the threat of new tariffs has been averted (for now).

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's break this down. When the Supreme Court told Trump "sorry, your tariffs are a no-go", the markets breathed a collective sigh of relief. After all, we all know that when you have $$\frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ$$, those tariffs are a LOSE-LOSE proposition. They drive up costs for businesses and consumers, without actually protecting American jobs. But here's the thing - this isn't the end of the story. Trump is already vowing to slap even MORE tariffs on our trading partners, because his fragile ego can't handle the L. So the markets are likely to remain volatile as long as this trade war drama continues. Still, for now, investors are happy to rejoice in the Supreme Court's smackdown of Trump's illegal protectionism.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks rebound as the immediate threat of new tariffs is lifted. But long-term uncertainty remains as Trump's trade war drama drags on.

### 8. TRUMP THROWS ANOTHER TANTRUM, THREATENS TO SLAP MORE ILLEGAL TARIFFS

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** After the Supreme Court ruled his global tariffs illegal, Trump is now threatening to raise existing tariffs and impose new ones. It's the economic equivalent of a toddler throwing a fit when they don't get their way.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's break this down. The Supreme Court basically told Trump: "Dude, your tariffs are BLATANTLY ILLEGAL. You can't just invoke national security to slap tariffs on everyone, that's not how this works." And you know what? They're absolutely right. When you have $$\frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ$$, it's crystal clear these tariffs are a lose-lose proposition for the US economy. But instead of accepting the L, Trump is throwing another one of his trademark tantrums. He's now threatening to RAISE existing tariffs and impose new ones, as if that's going to undo the damage he's already caused. It's the economic equivalent of a toddler stomping their feet and demanding more ice cream. The problem is, these new tariffs won't do anything to help American workers or businesses. All they'll do is drive up costs for consumers and spark retaliation from our trading partners. It's a recipe for economic disaster, but Trump is too busy playing dictator to care about the real-world consequences.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks plummet as investors realize Trump's trade war is far from over. Volatility is the name of the game as long as this toddler is in charge.

### 9. UNCLE SAM AND INDONESIA CALL IT TRUCE, LOWER TARIFFS TO 19%

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** After years of trade tensions, the US and Indonesia have finally reached a deal to lower tariffs on most goods to 19%. This is a win-win for both economies, as it reduces barriers to trade and boosts economic activity.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's dig into this. When you have $$Q = A K^{\alpha} L^{1-\alpha}$$ and $$P = \frac{W}{MPL}$$, it's pretty clear that lowering tariffs is good for both countries. By reducing those trade barriers, firms in the US and Indonesia can access cheaper inputs, boost productivity, and pass those savings on to consumers. And the real beauty of this deal? It's a classic case of comparative advantage in action. Both countries can now specialize in the goods they produce most efficiently, and then trade to meet their consumption needs. That means more $$\pi$$ for firms, more $$C$$ for households, and a healthier global economy all around. Sure, it's not as sexy as a good old-fashioned trade war. But sometimes, boring old free trade agreements are exactly what the doctor ordered. Kudos to Uncle Sam and Indonesia for putting aside the nationalist rhetoric and doing what's best for their citizens.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks climb as the US and Indonesia prove that trade wars are for losers. Global GDP gets a nice little boost from this sensible tariff reduction.

### 10. SUPREME COURT SMACKS DOWN TRUMP'S TARIFF TANTRUM

**⚙️ The Mechanism:** The Supreme Court has ruled against President Trump's sweeping global tariffs, saying they were imposed illegally. This is a major blow to Trump's protectionist agenda, but it doesn't undo the damage he's already done to the global trading system.

> **📊 The Analysis:** Alright, let's unpack this mess. The Supreme Court basically told Trump: "Sorry dude, but your tariffs are BLATANTLY ILLEGAL. You can't just invoke national security to slap tariffs on everyone, that's not how this works." And you know what? They're absolutely right. When you have $$\frac{dW}{dτ} = -Qτ$$, it's crystal clear these tariffs are a lose-lose proposition for the US economy. But here's the kicker - even though the Court struck down Trump's global tariffs, the damage is already done. He's upended the entire global trading system, sparking retaliatory tariffs and supply chain chaos. And now, other countries are realizing they can't rely on the US as a stable trading partner. So good luck trying to go back to the pre-Trump status quo - Humpty Dumpty ain't getting put back together anytime soon. And of course, Trump is already throwing another tantrum, threatening to raise existing tariffs and impose new ones. It's the economic equivalent of a toddler stomping their feet and demanding more ice cream. But these new tariffs won't do anything to help American workers or businesses. All they'll do is drive up costs for consumers and spark even more retaliation from our trading partners.

**📈 Market Call:** Stocks bounce back as the immediate threat of new tariffs is lifted. But long-term uncertainty remains as Trump's trade war drama drags on.
