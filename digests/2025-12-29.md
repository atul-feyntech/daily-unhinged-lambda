## Top Stories with Commentary

**1.** "Faking photos? Gee, I wonder if there could be any nefarious uses for that. Maybe the deepfake industry will give us all a nice holiday gift of even more misinformation and trust erosion. But hey, at least the tech is progressing, right? Silver linings and all that."
   [🔗 AI - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openais-new-chatgpt-image-generator-makes-faking-photos-easy/)


**2.** "Ah yes, those essential holiday candles—the perfect candlelit ambiance for when you're reflecting on how much more you're paying for them this year thanks to those 'job-saving' tariffs. Gotta love how ordinary consumers always end up footing the bill for trade wars, don't we?"
   [🔗 NPR Topics: Business](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/25/nx-s1-5651286/what-tariffs-have-meant-for-holiday-candle-sales)


**3.** "India and Australia, sitting in a trade deal, n-e-g-o-t-i-a-t-i-n-g. How quaint. I'm sure this 'comprehensive economic cooperation' will be a real boon for the common folk on both sides, and not just an excuse for corporations to squeeze a few more basis points out of the global supply chain."
   [🔗 Business News Today, Latest Finance News | The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/australia-to-remove-tariffs-on-100-of-indian-exports-from-january-1-says-piyush-goyal/article70449634.ece)


**4.** "Look, I get it—when your company's stock is trading 15% below its IPO price, you gotta do what you gotta do to shore up those investor confidence numbers. But let's not kid ourselves, this 'block deal' is just fancy financial jargon for the founder using company money to buy his own shares. Classic leadership move, that."
   [🔗 Markets-Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/honasa-consumer-block-deal-promoter-varun-alagh-ups-stake-in-mamaearth-parent-as-stock-trades-15-below-ipo-price/articleshow/126234367.cms)


**5.** "Ah yes, the 'upmarket cinema chain' seeing a 'leadership shake-up' after a 'profit warning.' Translation: the boss of your overpriced, bougie movie theaters just got the boot because, turns out, people don't actually want to pay $25 for a small popcorn and a lukewarm Coke. Who could've seen that coming?"
   [🔗 BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8q8zejgpdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss)


**6.** "Cyient DLM's profits surging 93% in FY24, huh? Gee, I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that they're a tech services company working in fields like aerospace and defense. You know, the kinds of industries that always seem to do so well when the global geopolitical situation goes to hell in a handbasket. Color me shocked."
   [🔗 Moneycontrol Business News](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cyient-dlm39s-profit-after-taxfy24-surges-93_17532091.html)


**7.** "The size of bank frauds is rising, even as the number of cases is declining? Well, color me unsurprised. It's almost like the banks are getting better at sweeping their misdeeds under the rug, while simultaneously finding ever-more creative ways to separate hapless customers from their money. Capitalism, baby!"
   [🔗 Business News Today, Latest Finance News | The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/size-of-bank-frauds-seen-rising-though-cases-on-a-decline-rbi-report/article70450129.ece)


**8.** "Ah yes, the good old 'heat wave and election season' combo—the secret sauce that spikes India's sugar demand. I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that politicians have a nasty habit of handing out freebies like candy (often literally) to win over voters. Nope, not a trace of quid pro quo here, folks."
   [🔗 Moneycontrol Economy News](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/india39s-sugar-demand-surgesheat-waveelection-season_17531591.html)


**9.** "Gross NPAs of banks at a 'multi-decade low,' huh? Well, color me skeptical. I'm willing to bet that's got more to do with banks finding sneaky ways to 'restructure' bad loans and hide their true financial health, rather than any actual improvement in the real economy. But hey, at least the numbers look good on paper, right?"
   [🔗 Business | The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/gross-npas-of-banks-fall-to-multi-decade-low-of-2-1-as-of-end-september-2025-rbi-report-10445213/)


**10.** "Muted year-end volumes, foreign fund outflows, a 'consolidation phase' favoring large-caps—sounds like a recipe for a good, old-fashioned market correction. But hey, at least the analysts are giving us a heads-up this time, instead of just letting retail investors get blindsided. Silver linings and all that, I suppose."
